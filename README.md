WIP: Looking into if I can build an erlang docker image for Raspberry PI (want it as a base for an Elixir image).

## TODO:

- [x] make it work
- [x] publish
- [ ] add build time to readme
- [ ] add missing dependencies and publish again

Will be published at https://hub.docker.com/r/joakimk/rpi-erlang/

## Installing and running

On a Raspberry Pi running [an OS with docker](http://blog.hypriot.com/downloads/):

    docker pull joakimk/rpi-erlang
    # or: docker pull joakimk/rpi-erlang:18.1.3

    docker run -i -t joakimk/rpi-erlang erl

## Building

This takes 77 minutes on a Raspberry Pi 2.

    make

## Publishing

    docker tag 5555555555 joakimk/rpi-erlang:version

    docker login
    docker push joakimk/rpi-erlang:version

## Known missing features from build output

Will fix these as I find the need for them, or someone else does.

                     WARNING:
                       Only gcc's __sync_* builtins available for
                       atomic memory access. This will cause lots
                       of expensive and unnecessary memory barrier
                       instructions to be issued which will make
                       the performance of the runtime system
                       suffer. You are *strongly* advised to
                       upgrade to a gcc version that supports the
                       __atomic_* builtins (at least gcc version
                       4.7) or build with libatomic_ops. See the
                       "Atomic Memory Operations and the VM"
                       chapter of $ERL_TOP/HOWTO/INSTALL.md for
                       more information.
